Welcome to Request Header Parser Microservice
=============================================

This microservice demonstrates parsing the request header to extract information for the response to the request to the endpoint. In order to demonstrate this the endpoint "/api/whoami" is exposed which will return the following JSON:

{ "ipaddress" : <ip_address> ,
  "language"  : <language>,
  "software"  : <computer_details> }

For example:
------------
{ "ipaddress" : "155.225.233.121",
  "language"  : "en-US",
  "software"  : "Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6" }
  
  
  
Project Details:
---------------
This microservice was made based on the [FCC Request Header Parser Microservice API Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/request-header-parser-microservice)
